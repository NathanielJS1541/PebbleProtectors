# Dom's notes

## On the existing game

The content of detecting spoofed WAPs was good.

Having the outcome when you win of something significant happening in the game
world like the police showing up is good encouragement.

The phishing spam game making reference to real online services like Fortnite
was good.

The access logs idea was good, but the UI was too frustrating to use. A proper
search interface and limiting each user to one IP address would have made it
much less painful.

A lot of the games are imitating real UI elements, that would be provided
natively for free by the browser. If doing these in-engine, common code for
them would be worth having.

The game of cross-referencing logins was good, but the mechanics of narrowing
down who did it were clunky, would have been nice to have ticks and crosses
next to a constant list of names. Would have been cool to integrate CCTV or
WAPs connection logs in different rooms or similar.

Having the explanation text require you to click on the text itself is good for
preventing accidental skipping, but it might be better to have previous and
next text buttons.

Manually entering firewall details was tedious, didn't really explain what an
IP or port or protocol was.

If we do ciphers, linking to cyberchef would be wise. It is self-hostable,
which should help with web blocking software.
