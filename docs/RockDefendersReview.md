# Rock Defenders Review

| Positives| Negatives
| ---- | ----
| ***Bayside School*** | ***Phishing Emails***
|Good content | Answers don't have any indication if they're correct or not
| ***Bland Group*** | ***Network topologies***
| | bit bland innit
| ***Gibraltar Police*** | ***Ciphers***
| Fun and short actvity | Reference table should be in game
| | If using binary, explain what it is?
| | Try and establish integrated toolbox so its never necessary to leave the game window
| | Incorrect answers aren't identified it just clears them all without saying which should be changed
| | Replace morse code with a more relevant cipher, like book cipher?
| | No colour hex which could create confusion, eg no pink/purple, no colourblind pairings
| ***Gitelecom*** | ***Firewalls***
| Setting up firewall rules is true to life | Could have a visual representation, Papers please-esque?
| ***Jebel Tarik Security*** | ***the hacking one***
| Good idea and fun "hacking" activity| Doesn't need the last third of the activity, it makes sense the last person who accessed the file would be the one to delete it, no need to check the IP address?
| | access log search only highlights the top option, doesn't show the others or filter out the rest
| | not the most accessible font, text is a bit overwhelming
| | doesn't actually say what an IP address is
| ***Bassadone Automotive***|  ***updating wifi security***
| important messaging | so boring!
| IoT, updating firmware, secure router password, automatic update devices| Repetitive, IoT not the most relevant?
| ***Kusuma Trust*** | ***rogue wifi***
| Dodgy wifi names | Too much text
| Finding rogue wifi sources | instead of being a white box somewhere, have it on someone's person
| | No notification of the game being completed
| ***EY Gibraltar*** | ***data leak investigation, dodgy usb***
| General favourite, good content | A bit too wordy
| Very step by step | Doesn't look like an actually used file directory
| Cross referencing between screens | Feels like there's no need to do lots of the repetitive activities: no need to go into each directory to check it each time?
| | Have a storyboard notepad that takes the information/conclusions necessary and have the links drawn explicitly between them
| ***Final challenge*** | ***Linux terminal activity***
| Good activity for anyone further interested in the subject | Would be good to have a list of commands available or commands that have been explained (could be revealed as they're learnt?)
| ***General points***|
| | A bit slow
| | The text boxes should have "previous" and "next" buttons
| | Have a notepad feature across all the games
| | More granular learning- direct notifications of correct or incorrect inputs
| | Include an activity for computer literacy- file directories, file extensions, file sizes (and expected sizes, e.g. picture thats too big = virus?)
| | Too much text
| | Hints?
