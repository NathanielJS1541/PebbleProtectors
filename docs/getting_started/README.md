# Getting Started Walkthrough

This document should act as a step-by-step guide, starting from no experience of coding or tools like `git`, to having your first commit pushed and reviewed in a pull request. It's a great place to start if you want to brush up on the use of things like `git` and the [phaser](https://github.com/phaserjs/phaser) framework, or learn on the go as you follow this guide.

Hopefully this is easy to follow, but if it's not just let us know in an [issue](https://github.com/NathanielJS1541/pebble_protectors/issues/new/choose) and we'll try to make it better.

Since this is a **full** walkthrough, it's been broken into different sections so that it doesn't look quite so overwhelming. Below you can find links to each section.
